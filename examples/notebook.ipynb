       "|**Abstract**| Hot and warm Jupiters (HJs and WJs correspondingly) are gas-giants orbiting their host stars at very short orbital periods ($P_{HJ}<10$ days; $10<P_{WJ}<200$ days). HJs and a significant fraction of WJs are thought to have migrated from an initially farther-out birth locations. While such migration processes have been extensively studied, the thermal evolution of gas-giants and its coupling to the the migration processes are usually overlooked. In particular, gas-giants end their core-accretion phase with large radii and then contract slowly to their final radii. Moreover, intensive heating can slow the contraction at various evolutionary stages. The initial inflated large radii lead to faster tidal migration due to the strong dependence of tides on the radius. Here we explore this accelerated migration channel, which we term inflated eccentric migration, using a semi-analytical self-consistent modeling of the thermal-dynamical evolution of the migrating gas-giants, later validated by our numerical model (see a companion paper, paper II). We demonstrate our model for specific examples and carry a population synthesis study. Our results provide a general picture of the properties of the formed HJs\\&WJs via inflated migration, and the dependence on the initial parameters/distributions. We show that tidal migration of gas-giants could occur far more rapidly then previously thought and lead to accelerated destruction and formation of HJs and enhanced formation rate of WJs. Accounting for the coupled thermal-dynamical evolution is therefore critical to the understanding of HJs/WJs formation, evolution and final properties of the population and play a key role in their migration process. |"

       "|**Abstract**| Most massive stars belong to multiple systems, yet the formation processleading to such high multiplicity remains insufficiently understood. To helpconstrain the different formation scenarios that exist, insights on thelow-mass end of the companion mass function of such stars is crucial. However,this is a challenging endeavour as (sub-)solar mass companions at angularseparations ($\\rho$) below 1\" (corresponding to 1000-3000 au in nearby youngopen clusters and OB associations) are difficult to detect due to the largebrightness contrast with the central star. With the Carina High-contrastImaging Project of massive Stars (CHIPS), we aim to obtain statisticallysignificant constraints on the presence and properties of low-mass companionsaround massive stars at a previously unreachable observing window ($\\Delta\\mathrm{mag} \\gtrsim 10$ at $\\rho \\lesssim$ 1\"). In this second paper in theseries, we focus on the Trumpler 14 cluster, which harbours some of theyoungest and most massive O-type stars in the Milky Way. We obtained VLT-SPHEREobservations of seven O-type objects in Trumpler 14 using the IRDIFS_EXT mode.These allow us to search for companions at separations larger than 0.\"15(approx. 360 au) and down to magnitude contrast $>10 \\mathrm{mag}$ in thenear-infrared. We used angular and spectral differential imaging along with PSFfitting to detect sources and measure their flux relative to that of thecentral object. We detected 211 sources with near-infrared magnitude contrastin the range of 2 to 12. The closest companion, at only 0.\"26, is characterisedas a 1.4M$_{\\odot}$ stars with an age of 0.6Myr, in excellent agreement withprevious age estimates for Tr 14. The mass function peaks at about0.4M$_{\\odot}$ and presents a dearth of stars in the 0.5 to 0.8M$_{\\odot}$ massrange compared to previous estimates of the initial mass function in Tr 14.|"

       "**Abstract:** The Trappist-1 system contains seven roughly Earth-sized planets locked in a multi-resonant orbital configuration,[1, 2] which has enabled precise measurements of the planets’ masses and constrained their compositions.[3] Here we use the system’s fragile orbital structure to place robust upper limits on the planets’ bombardment histories. We use N-body simulations to show how perturbations from additional objects can break the multi-resonant configuration by either triggering dynamical instability or simply removing the planets from resonance. The planets cannot have interacted with more than ∼5% of an Earth mass (M⊕) in planetesimals – or a single rogue planet more massive than Earth’s Moon – without disrupting their resonant orbital structure. This implies an upper limit of 10−4 to 10−2M⊕ of late accretion on each planet since the dispersal of the system’s gaseous disk. This is comparable to or less than the late accretion on Earth after the Moon-forming impact[4, 5], and demonstrates that the Trappist-1 planets’ growth was complete in just a few million years, roughly an order of magnitude faster than Earth’s.[6, 7] Our results imply that any large water reservoirs on the Trappist-1 planets must have been incorporated during their formation in the gaseous disk.\n",

       " **Abstract:** \\object{FS Canis Majoris}(FS CMa, HD 45677) is an unclassified B[e]star surrounded by an inclined dust disk. The evolutionary stage of FS CMa is still debated. Perpendicular to the circumstellar disk, a bipolar outflow was detected. Infrared aperture-synthesis imaging provides us with a unique opportunity to study the disk structure.Our aim is to study the intensity distribution of the disk of FS CMa in the mid-infrared$L$and$N$bands.We performed aperture-synthesis imaging of FS CMa with the MATISSE instrument (Multi AperTure mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment) in the low spectral resolution mode to obtain images in the$L$and$N$bands. We computed radiative transfer models that reproduce the$L$- and$N$-band intensity distributions of the resolved disks.We present$L$- and$N$-band aperture-synthesis images of FS CMa reconstructed in the wavelength bands of 3.4--3.8 and 8.6--9.0$\\mu$m. In the$L$-band image, the inner rim region of an inclined circumstellar disk and the central object can be seen with a spatial resolution of 2.7 milliarcsec (mas). An inner disk cavity with an angular diameter of$\\sim$6\\,$\\times$\\,12\\,mas is resolved. The$L$-band disk consists of a bright northwestern (NW) disk region and a much fainter southeastern (SE) region. The images suggest that we are looking at the bright inner wall of the NW disk rim, which is on the far side of the disk. In the$N$band, only the bright NW disk region is seen. In addition to deriving the inclination and the inner disk radius, fitting the reconstructed brightness distributions via radiative transfer modeling allows one to constrain the innermost disk structure, in particular the shape of the inner disk rim.\n",
